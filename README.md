2048 Explorations
=================

Nothing earth shattering.  Just curious exactly how many lines of code
it would take to implement 2048.

I'm also trying to stick with a "literate" approach.  Sadly, my
current setup isn't working.  Don't know if it is a problem in my file
or not.  Assuming it is.  Regardless, until I get the automatic
tangling done, it isn't difficult to put the file together.

I do not know the conventions in the node world for how to say what is
necessary.  So, I didn't try.  :(
