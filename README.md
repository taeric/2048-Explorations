2048 Explorations
=================

Nothing earth shattering.  Just curious exactly how many lines of code
it would take to implement 2048.

I'm also trying to stick with a "literate" approach.  So, all of the
code is simply tangled from the org files.  For the time being, I just
do the tangling directly in emacs.

I do not know the conventions in the node world for how to say what is
necessary.  So, I didn't try.  :(

Also, I've never actually tried "publishing" an org file.  So, for
now, I'm just putting the raw html of the export
[here](http://rawgit.com/taeric/2048-Explorations/master/2048.html).
